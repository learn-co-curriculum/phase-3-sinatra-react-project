A basic application that was meant to allow you to scroll through and read through dad jokes. If you create a user account on the website it would allow you to comment and rate each joke with the option to edit and delete your rating. You also have the option of adding a dad joke to the database, editing your own joke, and deleting your own joke. So far we only have the CRUD part of the jokes. The application was also created in hopes of creating data of which jokes people enjoy more and which jokes aren't enjoyed as much. Made by Harinder Singh & John Josef.
