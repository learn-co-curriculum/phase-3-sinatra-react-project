#maintreq should be join table (belong to owner, belong to unit). 

#newmaintreq should have owner ID and unit ID.

#going to have to review migrations, etc. in order to fix some things here. 

#date closed should be null on open reqs. this will be changed when the user marks as closed on the front end.

#as user, I am manager. first, i can see an overview of current units. 
    # - lets add in a column for owner name, to the right of Owner ID in units overview. 
    #from the unit overview, I can see which unit has an open request. 

#in open reqs, I can 
    #see all info about requests, inlcluding tenant and owner
    #delete a request (in case of mistake, etc.)
    #update the open request to closed - once this is done I should no longer see the request (as it has been marked closed) 
            #this means that open_req boolean needs to be in maintreq, not in unit.
        #update actual cost - we make note of expected cost while subbing form, and actual cost at time of closing the open request.


    #in all (past) requests, i can
        #see all requests, including those currently open and reqs that have been closed.
