I went in right after 10 and was told they dont start serving soft serve until 10:30. I waited until in the parking lot less than 30 minutes and went back in line and ordered again and the worker said they aren't serving soft serve and I said I was just here 30 minutes ago and was told it would be ready at 10:30am. Then the worker said okay and I guess they magically had it again. Hmm...anyways, I paid for it and it was handed over. Definitely not good service, but the soft serve was good!", restaurant: McDonalds)

However, we were surprised at how nice and accommodating the manager was. We honestly weren't bothered by the wait, but she was so generous and gave us the cucumber appetizer on the house and we appreciate her for taking the time and effort on doing something out of their way. Also, it was absolutely on my end, but I miscommunicated something with our server, Hannah. It was totally my fault, but she was VERY nice and accommodating towards dealing with my mistakes and everything worked out in the end. Accidentally ordered a couple of extra stuff, but tbh I'm just excited I can eat more DTF for later. I just want to thank her for handling our situation really well :^) Can't forget to mention how yummy everything was. I've been here a bunch of times, but it was the first for the rest of my family and they allied LOVED it. We are very excited to go back again !", restaurant: Din_Tai)
