        "lyrics": "She'd take the world off my shoulders If it was ever hard to move She'd turn the rain to a rainbow When I was living in the blue Why then, if she is so perfect Do I still wish that it was you? Perfect don't mean that it's working So what can I do? (Ooh) When you're out of sight In my mind 'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes And that's where I find a glimpse of us And I try to fall for her touch But I'm thinking of the way it was Said I'm fine and said I moved on I'm only here passing time in her arms Hoping I'll find A glimpse of us Tell me he savors your glory Does he laugh the way I did? Is this a part of your story? One that I had never lived Maybe one day you'll feel lonely And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse Maybe you'll start slipping slowly And find me again When you're out of sight In my mind 'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes And that's where I find a glimpse of us And I try to fall for her touch But I'm thinking of the way it was Said I'm fine and said I moved on I'm only here passing time in her arms Hoping I'll find A glimpse of us Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh-ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh 'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes And that's where I find a glimpse of us And I try to fall for her touch But I'm thinking of the way it was Said I'm fine and said I moved on I'm only here passing time in her arms Hoping I'll find A glimpse of us"
